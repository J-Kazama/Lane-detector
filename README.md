This is to give an idea of what is going on in the process of detection--branch 2 is for the full operation of detection over the frames of a video. 

The order of the methods written in the main program is the order through which the necessary filtering is achieved to detect lane lines. Utilizing machine learning is another option for detecting lines and is more appropriate for large scale deployment, however with OpenCV quality results can be achieved for the general case.
